The following is an example of how the Streamlit App should work:
-Calls the function for get_auth_token to run
-Calls the function for get_slates to run
-Calls the function for get_game_schedule to run
-Calls the function for get_player_projections to run


The following is an example of the layout of the Streamlit App
-Sidebar that has a calendar for the user to select a date which would be passed to the functions being called
-A display of the all_players_df outside of the sidebar
-Inside the sidebar there should also be a way for a user to select a game to filter the displayed (all_players_df) the options in which
the user has to select would come from the (games_df) an example of how that (games_df) data looks is below
